experimental repo.
trying to decouple inputs from the main mixing / processing

results so far:
    - improved handling of cameras being disconnected.
    - less cpu usage, this is something I didn't expect.
    - now it lets us have fixed 'slots' assigned to a camera

many things left, some are:
    cleanup of this mess
    behaviour when a camera is disconnected
        - hide the preview or leave it showing black?
        - if hide then switching with keyboard must take account of that (now it doesn't)
    when it comes back give feedback that it did (re-show the spinner?)

dependencies:
    - pyudev from https://github.com/inaes-tic/pyudev , branch 'gobject-introspection'
    - GStreamer 1.2 ecosystem (we use stable 1.2 from git)
    - you may want to patch gst-plugins-bad/gst/inter/gstinteraudiosrc.c with:

This is not strictly necessary nor correct.
