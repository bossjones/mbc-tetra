experimental repo.
trying to decouple inputs from the main mixing / processing

results so far:
    with hacked interaudiosrc it kind of works, glass to glass latency is not great, sometimes
    when adding a new camera it lags a lot from the other. But, cpu usage drops. not bothered too much
    with the preview sinks, it shouldn't matter that they are in they own window instead of the main.

will try with shm next.

with SHM:
    performance is better, can have multiple readers.
    if the shmsink pipeline dies all the sources error
    need to be very specific about caps when using shmsrc

    "gst_audio_buffer_clip: assertion `segment->format == GST_FORMAT_TIME || segment->format == GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT' failed" liveadder at fault?
    and no joy. if I don't link the shmsrc's i can get audio / video with gst-launch-1.0. Seems adder / liveadder and videomixer don't like
    what shmsrc produces.
    try again with patch from https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=702842 applied, 

    ok it works now,cpu usage is a tad higher than the inter version but still lower than the original case. Something murky is going on
    with the timestamps as liveadder refuses to work , so back to using adder but it will bite later.
