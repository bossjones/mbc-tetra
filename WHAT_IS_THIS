trying to decouple inputs from the main mixing / processing

results so far:
    with hacked interaudiosrc it kind of works, glass to glass latency is not great, sometimes
    when adding a new camera it lags a lot from the other. But, cpu usage drops. not bothered too much
    with the preview sinks, it shouldn't matter that they are in they own window instead of the main.

will try with shm next.
